# YouTube Comment Analysis SaaS - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Elevator Pitch  
The YouTube Comment Analysis SaaS platform automates the collection, processing, and interpretation of YouTube video comments using NLP-driven sentiment analysis and topic clustering. It delivers actionable insights via a customizable dashboard, enabling creators and marketing teams to optimize content and audience engagement—all while handling large volumes of data reliably and securely.

## 2. Who is this app for?  
- **YouTube Creators:** Solo creators looking for quick insights and actionable feedback.  
- **Marketing Teams & Agencies:** Professionals needing detailed analysis for strategic content improvements.  
- **Content Strategists:** Users who want data-driven insights to refine video content.

## 3. Functional Requirements  
- **Data Ingestion & Retrieval:**  
  - Users submit a YouTube video URL to fetch public comments using the YouTube Data API.  
  - Handle API rate limits and pagination; include fallback/retry mechanisms if the API fails.  
  - Securely store comments, with performance benchmarks (e.g., handling up to 50,000 comments per video).

- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis:**  
  - Process comments asynchronously with ML models (Hugging Face Transformers, TextBlob, etc.).  
  - Generate sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) with confidence levels.  
  - Perform topic clustering and keyword extraction for common themes.

- **Dashboard & Visual Reporting:**  
  - Provide an interactive dashboard with visualizations: pie charts, time-series graphs, word clouds, and bubble charts.  
  - Enable filtering by sentiment, date range, or topic with drill-down capabilities.  
  - Include clear error messages and notifications when external API calls or processing fail.

- **Actionable Insights:**  
  - Auto-generate key takeaways and recommendations (e.g., “Consider adding subtitles” based on recurring issues).  
  - Highlight critical feedback such as technical problems or common praise points.

- **Scalability & Performance:**  
  - Use an async job queue to manage large comment datasets.  
  - Define performance targets and load testing benchmarks (e.g., system should process X comments within Y seconds).  
  - Plan for horizontal scaling as more creators and videos are added.

- **Security & Reliability:**  
  - Use OAuth and secure API tokens to ensure authorized access.  
  - Sanitize all comment inputs to protect against injection attacks.  
  - Monitor system health via tools (e.g., Datadog, Sentry) and enforce robust error logging and recovery processes.
